# Background

According to a survey report released by the World Health Organization (WHO), there are currently over three billion people worldwide who require psychological intervention due to mental health issues. However, only approximately 10% of them have had access to psychological counseling. Furthermore, there is a severe shortage of professional psychologists globally, with specialized counseling services primarily concentrated in economically developed regions. Disparities in resource allocation between urban and rural areas also pose a significant challenge.

# Demand Analysis

Mental health issues are a widespread concern, with a vast potential demand for services, especially as economic development leads more people to prioritize their mental well-being. Awareness and understanding of psychological counseling have also grown. However, in many regions around the world, particularly in developing countries, the field of psychological counseling remains in a state of mixed quality. Issues such as treatment effectiveness and pricing pose significant challenges. These factors contribute to a lower level of acceptance and utilization of psychological counseling services by many individuals.

# Industry Status

In general, especially in developing regions, the cost of training a qualified and excellent psychological counselor is exceptionally high. This indirectly results in a certain threshold for individuals who can access psychological counseling services. The cost per counseling session is often substantial, making it a significant expense for average-income families.

In rural areas with limited infrastructure and economic constraints, it is impractical to establish large-scale professional psychological counseling institutions. These regions often experience a high prevalence of psychological issues, particularly among left-behind children. There is a lack of psychological education and effective intervention measures for the formation of values in these areas.
