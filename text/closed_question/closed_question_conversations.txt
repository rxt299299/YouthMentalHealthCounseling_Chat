Q: 1. I always feel uncomfortable when interacting with others. 2. Yes, when I talk to teachers and classmates, I always feel reserved, unable to relax, and worried about saying the wrong thing. When interacting with strangers, this situation becomes even worse, and sometimes I feel afraid. 3. I'm afraid that others will have an unfriendly attitude towards me and look down on me. 4. Mm-hmm.
A: Has your fear affected your normal interaction with classmates?
Q: 1. Personally, I don't really mind, but my family cares a lot. They often compare me to other kids and say things like, "Look at other kids, they excel in their studies and even got scholarships. You, on the other hand, can't do anything right, you can't even study properly." I used to explain to them how hard I was trying, how dedicated I was, but now I don't want to talk to them anymore. It's useless; they still criticize me. I feel that no matter how hard I try now, I can't achieve the results they want. I feel like I'm really inferior to others!
A: Have there been times when you didn't put in effort?
Q: 1. Like last week, our class had a parent-teacher meeting, and other students had their fathers and mothers with them. They looked so happy, while I only had my mom, and she was late. When the meeting started, they all sat with their parents, and I was alone. Watching them laugh, I felt like they were mocking me. They were whispering with their parents, and I felt like they were talking about me. I had to lower my head and twist my fingers; I felt really sad.
A: Have you ever asked your mom why she was late for the parent-teacher meeting?
Q: 1. Really? Maybe I should talk to my mom about it. But I'm still afraid she'll say I'm not sensible. 2. The most important thing between people is communication. If we don't express our inner thoughts, how can others know? Every mother loves their child, and as long as you talk to her, she will definitely understand. This way, the conflicts between you and your mom, your emotional burdens, will be resolved, right? 3. Maybe you're right.
A: So let's talk about your relationship with your classmates now. Have your classmates told you that they exclude you and don't want to hang out with you?
Q: 1. Yeah, I think I should be an outgoing person, but after my parents' divorce, I became introverted. I'm always afraid of saying the wrong thing and pushing them away, making them dislike me, just like how my dad left me. 2. In a way, you lack a sense of security, and you feel that your parents' divorce is related to you, which has made you lose confidence.
A: Has your mom ever blamed you, saying that it's because of you that she divorced your dad?
Q: 1. I hate this feeling so much; it prevents me from interacting with others normally. I wish I could interact smoothly and successfully with people. 2. Usually, I have high standards for myself, and my schedule is quite tight. Besides exercising, I spend most of my time on academics, hoping to achieve something. 3. Occasionally, I play, but I always feel that chatting and playing cards all day is a waste of life. We shouldn't live like that. 4. Yeah, quite a bit. I feel like they often waste their time and lives.
A: So, do you feel like you're better than them?
Q: 1. Yes, it seems like I often don't express what I really want, and when I do, it's not something I really want. 2. Yes, maybe it has become a habit. (Silence) 3. I feel very weak, not independent, not mature enough. Maybe others will look down on me.
A: When others express their inner needs in front of you, do you ever feel that they are immature and that you look down on them?
Q: 1. This situation has a big impact on me. 2. I got engaged a year ago, and at first, my boyfriend didn't know (I tried my best to restrain from washing my hands too often), and our relationship was great. But after a while, he found out, and now he's annoyed with me.
A: He didn't know at first
Q: 1. No, he didn't know. At first, I didn't want to tell him, but later, I had no choice but to tell him. 2. My mom told me that I was born prematurely, and I was weak since childhood. When I was three years old, I still walked unsteadily. To prevent the neighborhood kids from bullying me, my mother took great care of me. She emphasized cleanliness and hygiene to keep me from getting sick. My academic performance has always been good. My homework was meticulous, and my notebooks were neat and clean. I often received praise from teachers for this. But it seemed like the other kids didn't like my seriousness, responsibility, and seriousness. I was often isolated, and sometimes I even became the target of pranks. When I got home, I felt like I had less pressure. Sometimes I would walk and skip around, humming to myself. My mom loved me and praised me, but sometimes she got angry. Especially when she was in a hurry to cook and go to work, she would yell at me, "A whole cabbage, and you've been washing it for half an hour~" But I remained calm, continuing to wash until it was completely clean.
A: You feel very uncomfortable and pained about this situation, don't you?
Q: 1. I did poorly in the college entrance examination. 2. I couldn't even get into an ordinary university, and I don't know why it turned out this way. 3. Yeah, I always had good academic performance. I even passed the cutoff for a prestigious university in the mock exams. I thought I could get into a top-tier university, but when the results came out, it was like this. I still can't figure out what went wrong.
A: So, you think it was a problem with the exam papers, is that it
Q: 1. Both my parents are civil servants, but our family's financial situation is just average. 2. My relationships with teachers and classmates have always been good. When the college entrance exam results came out, both teachers and classmates were very surprised. 3. I feel very unhappy; I don't want to go out, and I don't want to attend supplementary classes.
A: Does this mean that this issue has been bothering you since after the college entrance exam?
Q: 1. I didn't do well in the final exams. I felt really annoyed when the results came out, especially recently. The more I think about it, the angrier I get, and my mood gets worse. The English CET-4 exam is coming up, and I can't focus on studying. I'm always nervous and irritable, and sometimes I can't even eat! 2. I didn't fail any courses, even though I studied for a long time, I still didn't achieve satisfactory results. Some classmates hardly studied during regular days; they didn't even pay much attention to their studies. They always played around. But during exams, they would suddenly study or even cheat and get excellent grades. There's also comprehensive assessment; I didn't see them participating in any activities, they just relied on connections to earn so many credits, while my credits are not high. I really feel like I'm getting dumber and worse than everyone else.
A: So, do you feel like the final exams are very unfair to you?
Q: 1. Actually, it's not so much about fairness; it's just that I feel dumb. I really feel dumb. I work hard, but I can't study well. I always can't find the right study method, and my study efficiency is really low. My grades are just not good.
A: Based on what you're saying, are you particularly concerned about your academic performance?
