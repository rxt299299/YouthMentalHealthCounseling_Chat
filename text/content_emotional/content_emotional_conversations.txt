Q: Visitor: I'm afraid that others will have an unfriendly attitude towards me and look down on me.
A: Counselor: It's normal to feel some nervousness and worry when interacting with people you're not familiar with for the first time.
Q: Visitor: Yes. Because I feel uncomfortable when interacting with others, and when I'm alone, I feel natural. I try to avoid contact with others as much as possible and often study alone. As a result, some of my previous friends are now in contact with me less and less, and sometimes I have to interact with strangers, and my first reaction is whether I can avoid it. It has a significant impact on my normal life.
A: Counselor: Oh, this fear has had a significant impact on your daily life. How do you perceive this fear that you're experiencing?
Q: Visitor: Every time my mother takes me to the mall, when I see clothes or delicious food I like, I really want them, but it's hard for me to speak up. Sometimes, when my mother asks me if I want them, I say I don't like them, even though it's not true. Later, I just stopped going to the mall with my mother to avoid making her uncomfortable, but I wasn't happy either. But I really hate this behavior of not being true to myself.
A: Counselor: I understand your actions at the time. It was commendable that you didn't want to make your mother uncomfortable. It was a sign of maturity, but it also developed a habit of saying one thing and doing another.

Q: Visitor: I remember one day, I served a customer. This customer looked emaciated, as if seriously ill. A hand with bulging veins, like an eagle's claw, was trembling continuously, handing over a crumpled and greasy tissue to me. Out of professional ethics and politeness, I took the tissue, unfolded it, and then found the change and delivered the goods. I did all this almost holding my breath. When the customer left, coughing and spitting, I felt nauseous and a rush of heat rising in my abdomen. I hurried to the restroom to wash my hands repeatedly. Even after I got home from work, I still felt that my hands weren't clean, so I washed them with soap and then with scented soap, repeatedly, without end. Not long after that, I started having thoughts that I must wash my hands.
A: Counselor: Oh, because of the customer's behavior, you developed a compulsion to wash your hands, is that correct?
Q: Visitor: Yes, I'm in a lot of pain. Sometimes, I don't even want to live.
A: Counselor: What you just told me is that you have an excessive need for cleanliness, a fear of having dirty hands, and a compulsion to wash them repeatedly, even though you know it's unnecessary. This is causing you a lot of distress and affecting your work and life. Is that correct?
Q: Visitor: I couldn't even get into an ordinary college. I don't know why.
A: Counselor: So, failing the college entrance exam had a significant impact on you, and it's been troubling you, right?
Q: Visitor: I'm worried that I won't do well on the exams and that I'll let my parents down. When I think about it, I feel restless.
A: Counselor: So, you're saying that you're anxious about the exams and afraid of disappointing your parents. Can I ask if your parents have high expectations for your grades?
Q: Visitor: They haven't explicitly stated any expectations, but I can feel their hopes when we talk. They want me to get into a prestigious university.
A: Counselor: I see, parents generally have high hopes for their children's success. Does the expectation from your parents create a lot of pressure for you?
Q: Visitor: The results weren't great... it seems like it's even worse now...
A: Counselor: Earlier, you mentioned that you had put in a lot of effort for the exams, but due to improper study methods, your study efficiency was low, and your grades weren't ideal. You've already recognized your problem. Imagine if you find the right study methods, would you still not work hard?
Q: Visitor: I come from a single-parent family, and I'm in the fifth grade this year. I always feel like I'm different from my classmates, maybe it's because of my personality. I find it difficult to get along well with them, and I'm usually afraid to talk to my classmates. They don't seem to pay much attention to me, which makes me walk with my head down, watching them happily, but I can't seem to fit into their world.
A: Counselor: The factors of coming from a single-parent family make you feel inferior, the indifference of your classmates makes you feel lonely, and the difficulty in getting along with them makes you feel troubled, right?
Q: Visitor: Like last week, our class had a parent-teacher meeting, and all the other students had their dads and moms with them. They looked so happy, while I only had my mom attending. When the meeting started, they all sat with their parents, and I was just alone. Watching them laugh, I always felt like they were mocking me. I felt they were talking about me. I had to lower my head and fidget with my fingers. I felt very sad.
A: Counselor: Your mom's lateness, the absence of your dad at the parent-teacher meeting, and seeing other students with their parents while you were alone made you feel unhappy, right?
