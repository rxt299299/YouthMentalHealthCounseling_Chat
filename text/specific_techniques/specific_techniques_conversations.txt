Q: Visitor: I feel very uncomfortable when interacting with others.
A: Counselor: When you mention "others," are you referring to teachers, classmates, or strangers? (Explanation: To address the visitor's discomfort during interactions, please ask them to provide more details about who specifically makes them feel uncomfortable.)
Q: Visitor: It's all of them. When I talk to teachers and classmates, I always feel very reserved, unable to relax, and worried about saying the wrong things. When I interact with strangers, this feeling becomes even more severe, and I even feel afraid.
A: Counselor: What are you afraid of? (Explanation: The visitor described feeling reserved and fearful during interactions. Please ask them to describe in detail why they feel afraid.)
Q: Visitor: Yes, because I feel uncomfortable when interacting with others, I tend to avoid contact with people as much as possible. I often study alone and read books by myself. As a result, my interactions with some of my previous friends have decreased, and sometimes I inevitably have to interact with strangers, and my first reaction is whether I can avoid it. This has a significant impact on my daily life.
A: Counselor: Oh, this fear is significantly affecting your daily life. How do you perceive this feeling of fear? (Explanation: The visitor discussed their fear and discomfort during interactions and how it impacts their life. Please ask them to describe their feelings about this fear.)
Q: Visitor: I despise this feeling. It prevents me from interacting normally with others. I wish I could interact smoothly and successfully with others.
A: Counselor: How do you typically set expectations for yourself? (Explanation: The visitor mentioned their inner feelings and how they may be related to their high self-expectations. Please ask them to describe how they usually set expectations for themselves.)
Q: Visitor: I had a happy childhood, and my parents doted on me. Unfortunately, my father passed away when I was eight years old due to illness, and I was very sad. Later, my mother formed a new family, and she invested most of her energy and time in adjusting family relationships. She became less carefree in her actions, constantly had many concerns, and the family's financial situation wasn't great either.
A: Counselor: How did you feel at that time? (Explanation: The visitor described their childhood experiences in detail. Please ask them to describe how they felt at that time and what impact it had on their emotions.)
Q: Visitor: I didn't like my stepfather; I always had a subtle sense of rejection. I felt that he was always indecisive, lacking a masculine demeanor, and he always seemed to be competing with me for my mother's attention. Nevertheless, I am very understanding of my mother, and I always think about sharing her burdens, trying to make her worry less and not put her in difficult situations.
A: Counselor: I'm sorry for bringing up unpleasant memories. How do you typically share your mother's burdens? Can you give an example? (Explanation: The visitor talked about their family dynamics related to their stepfather and mother. Ask them to provide a specific example of how they share their mother's burdens.)
Q: Visitor: Yes, it's like I often desire something but can't express it, and when I do express it, it's not something I really want.
A: Counselor: You desire independence while also craving care and assistance from others. This long-standing psychological conflict has led to inner contradictions. Do you often experience this phenomenon when interacting with friends as well? (Explanation: The visitor shared and summarized their reasons. Ask them to recall whether this phenomenon also occurs when interacting with friends.)
Q: Visitor: I constantly feel the need to wash my hands repeatedly, fearing that they are not clean. Although I know it's unnecessary, I can't control it, and it's very distressing. I don't want to do anything, and I'm afraid to do anything. Even going to work has become difficult.
A: Counselor: Could you describe it in more detail? (Explanation: The visitor described their distressing behavior of repeatedly washing hands. Ask them to provide specific details about this behavior.)
Q: Visitor: No.
A: Counselor: What is the most memorable incident related to this? (Explanation: Ask the visitor to describe the most memorable incident related to their behavior.)
Q: Visitor: Yeah.
A: Counselor: You seem quite down. Has something happened recently? Would you like to tell me what's going on? (Explanation: Considering the visitor's previous conversation, they appear to be in low spirits, and their response is brief. Please ask them to provide a detailed description of what might have caused their current emotional state.)
Q: Visitor: (Silence) I performed poorly in the college entrance examination.
A: Counselor: So, you didn't achieve the expected score in your college entrance examination, is that right? (Explanation: The visitor mentioned their poor performance in the college entrance examination. Ask them to elaborate on what exactly happened.)
Q: Visitor: But later, I had someone verify my scores, and it turned out they were correct.
A: Counselor: If you don't think it's an issue with the test papers being scored incorrectly, could you tell me about your situation during the period leading up to the college entrance examination? (Explanation: The visitor mentioned their college entrance examination and that their scores were verified. Please ask them to provide more details about the events surrounding their college entrance examination.)
Q: Visitor: Well, it's like this. In the two weeks leading up to the exam, I had some emotional issues. I would feel uneasy, have trouble sleeping at night, lose my appetite, and worry a lot about the upcoming college entrance examination.
A: Counselor: What do you think might have caused these psychological and physiological changes in you during that time? (Explanation: The visitor described their emotional and physical state before the college entrance examination. Ask them to analyze what might have caused these changes.)
Q: Visitor: I was worried that I would perform poorly, and I was afraid of letting my parents down. Thinking about it made me very anxious.
A: Counselor: So, you're saying you were anxious because you were afraid of not performing well and disappointing your parents. Can I ask if your parents have high expectations for your academic performance? (Explanation: The visitor mentioned their fear of not doing well in the exam and disappointing their parents. Continue to inquire if this fear is related to high parental expectations.)
Q: Visitor: They haven't explicitly set any expectations, but I can sense their hopes when we talk. They want me to get into a prestigious university.
A: Counselor: I see. Parents often have high hopes for their children's success. Does their hope create a significant amount of pressure for you? (Explanation: The visitor mentioned that their parents haven't explicitly set expectations but they can sense their hopes. Continue to explore if this unspoken pressure is affecting them.)
Q: Visitor: My relationships with teachers and classmates have always been good. After the college entrance examination results came out, both the teachers and classmates were very surprised.
A: Counselor: What changes did you notice in yourself after this happened? (Explanation: The visitor continued to talk about their college entrance examination. Ask them to elaborate on any personal changes they experienced.)
Q: Visitor: I didn't perform well in the final exams, and I felt very unhappy when I received the results. Especially recently, the more I think about it, the angrier I become, and my mood worsens. I have the English proficiency test coming up soon, but I can't concentrate on studying. I constantly feel nervous and agitated, and sometimes I even lose my appetite!
A: Counselor: So, how did you do in your final exams? (Explanation: The visitor mentioned their dissatisfaction with their final exam results and their emotional reactions. Ask them to provide more details about their exam performance.)
Q: Visitor: Yes, I always feel that my classmates look down on me and avoid me because of the way I am. It makes me uncomfortable in school.
A: Counselor: Are you saying that you feel your classmates look down on you? Can you specify how you've come to this conclusion? (Explanation: The visitor mentioned feeling that their classmates look down on them and avoid them. Ask them to provide specific incidents or reasons for this feeling.)
Q: Visitor: Well, I understand her. My mom believes that academic success is the path to a brighter future, so she's very concerned about my studies. She doesn't miss any opportunity to communicate with my teachers. But...
A: Counselor: But you still feel like other classmates are happier than you, right? So, what do you think would make you feel happy? (Explanation: The visitor discussed their mother's control over their studies. Continue to explore if this is causing their unhappiness.)
