Q: I didn't do well in my final exams. When the results came out, I was really upset, especially recently. The more I think about it, the angrier I get, and my mood gets worse.

Q: I didn't fail any subjects, though I studied for a long time. I'm not satisfied with my results. Some classmates hardly studied during normal days, they always play around. But when it comes to exams, they either cram at the last minute or use cheat sheets, and they score really well. Then there's the comprehensive evaluation (综测); I haven't seen them participate in any activities, but they still earn so many credits. My own credit score isn't high. I feel like I'm getting dumber and worse than others.

Q: I don't really care much about it myself, but my family cares a lot. They often compare me to other kids and say, 'Look at those kids from other families, they excel in their studies, they even get scholarships, and look at you, you can't do anything, not even your studies.' I used to explain to them that I work hard and am very diligent, but now I don't want to say anything to them anymore. It's pointless; they'll still criticize me. I feel like no matter how hard I try, I can't meet their expectations. I really feel inferior to others!
